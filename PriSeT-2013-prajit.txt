ABSTRACT 


Mobile 
devices 
can 
better 
manage 
user 
privacy 
if 
they 
continuousl
y 
model 
a 
user's 
context, 
but 
doing 
so 
can 
result 
in 
high 
energy 
consumption. 
We 
describe 
an 
approach 
to 
reducing 
energy 
costs 
by 
reasoning 
about 
what 
context 
informatio
n 
is 
known, 
what 
additional 
information 
is 
needed, 
how 
accurate 
it 
must 
be 
and 
how 
to 
eciently 
acquire 
it. 
We 
model 
the 
sensors 
and 
their 
data 
properties, 
accuracy 
levels 
and 
energy 
costs 
in 
a 
knowledge 
base 
supported 
by 
an 
ontology. 
We 
describe 
a 
method 
to 
manage 
privacy 
on 
smartphones 
in 
an 
energy 
ecient 
manner 
by 
selecting 
the 
best 
choice 
sensor 
for 
maintaining 
the 
user's 
context 
information
. 
Sensor 
selection 
is 
done 
by 
COntext 
MANager 
miD-Dleware 
(COMANDD), 
which 
maintains 
a 
context 
model 
and 
answers 
queries 
about 
it. 
Context 
requests 
are 
served 
by 
capability 
matching, 
accuracy 
level 
matching 
and 
selectio
n 
of 
lowest 
energy 
cost 
sensor 
for 
reporting 
context 
data. 
A 
context 
change 
detection 
function 
is 
used 
to 
decide 
when 
the 
context 
should 
be 
updated.

INTRODUCTION 
Contemporary 
enterprise 
work 
environments 
are 
witnessing 
a 
signicant 
rise 
in 
accommodation 
or 
adoption 
of 
the 
Bring-Your-Own-Device 
(BYOD) 
model. 
Concerns 
over 
corporate 
data 
protection 
has 
led 
to 
security 
rms 
actively 
researchin
g 
the 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
of 
using 
such 
a 
model. 
Ionic 
Security, 
an 
Atlanta 
based 
startup 
recently 
raised 
$9.4 
million 
to 
develop 
its 
technology 
for 
enabling 
employees 
to 
access 
data 
on 
their 
own 
devices 
[11]. 
The 
focus 
of 
privacy 


* 


Support 
for 
this 
work 
was 
provided 
by 
NSF 
grant 
0910838 
and 
MURI 
award 
FA9550-08-1-0265 
from 
the 
Air 
Force 
Ofc
e 
of 
Scientic 
Research. 


or 
security 
rms 
has 
remained 
on 
securing 
the 
data 
in 
case 
of 
loss 
of 
the 
device 
[7] 
or 
IT 
implementation 
and 
economic 
challenges 
[9]. 
One 
approach 
for 
providing 
privacy 
to 
corporat
e 
data 
is 
the 
container 
based 
approach. 
Samsung 
and 
Blackberry, 
through 
their 
SAFE 
(SAmsung 
For 
Enterprises) 


[12] 
and 
Balance 
[10] 
systems 
provided 
separate 
containers 
for 
corporate 
data. 
Container 
based 
approaches 
provide 
securit
y 
to 
corporate 
data 
but 
with 
larger 
overheads 
of 
securit
y 
enhanced 
operating 
systems 
and 
separate 
application 
groups. 
However, 
container 
based 
systems 
ignore 
user 
context 
data 
ow 
and 
modern 
smartphones 
are 
capable 
of 
much 
more 
than 
just 
storing 
corporate 
data 
i.e. 
they 
can 
gather 
tremendou
s 
amounts 
of 
information 
about 
the 
user 
and 
her 
context. 
User 
data 
and 
context 
leakage 
thus, 
becomes 
an 
enormous 
issue 
with 
potentially 
disastrous 
results. 
Naturally, 
we 
recognize
d 
the 
move 
to 
BYOD 
model 
as 
a 
major 
challenge, 
making 
privacy 
management 
on 
smartphones 
an 
important 
goal. 
Advances 
made 
in 
context 
modeling, 
location 
tracking 
and 
collaborative 
localization 
has 
resulted 
in 
emergence 
of 
a 
class 
of 
smartphone 
apps 
that 
can 
access 
and 
share 
embedde
d 
sensor 
and 
context 
data. 
Current 
security 
and 
privacy 
mechanisms 
on 
Android 
and 
other 
mobile 
operating 
systems 
are 
not 
well 
equipped 
to 
handle 
dynamic 
data 
ow 
between 
the 
framework 
and 
the 
applications. 


In 
our 
previous 
work, 
we 
have 
shown 
application 
and 
user 
context-dependent 
information 
sharing 
policies 
that 
dynamicall
y 
control 
data 
ow 
among 
applications 
at 
a 
ne-grained 
level1 
. 
We 
use 
semantically 
rich 
policies 
to 
dynamically 
monitor 
and 
control 
the 
data 
ow 
between 
the 
sensors 
and 
the 
apps 
on 
a 
smartphone 
[5]. 
This 
second 
approach 
to 
privacy 
management 
is 
ner 
grained 
and 
more 
robust 
and 
carries 
less 
overhead 
than 
container 
based 
systems 
described 
above. 


The 
other 
challenge 
apart 
from 
privacy 
management 
comes 
from 
the 
separate 
but 
equally 
vital 
problem 
of 
limited 
batter
y 
capacity, 
on 
smartphones. 
Users’ 
expectations 
from 
their 
smartphones 
are 
increasing 
every 
day 
and 
thus 
the 
need 
for 
them 
to 
do 
more 
computation 
is 
also 
increasing. 
However, 
the 
ability 
of 
batteries 
to 
power 
these 
devices 
are 
not 
increasing 
as 
fast 
as 
the 
processing 
capabilities 
[1]. 
Therefore
, 
there 
is 
a 
necessity 
to 
preserve 
the 
battery 
as 
much 
as 
possible, 
thus 
extending 
the 
battery 
life. 


1Application 
and 
App 
are 
both 
used 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
same 
concept, 
of 
an 
Android 
App 
in 
this 
paper 



While 
policy 
based 
privacy 
management 
has 
its 
advantages, 
it 
does 
require 
the 
latest 
context 
to 
be 
available 
at 
all 
times. 
Therefore 
necessitating 
context 
update 
at 
a 
high 
frequency. 
This 
unfortunately 
creates 
a 
serious 
hindrance 
due 
to 
the 
limited 
battery 
capacity 
on 
smartphones. 
We 
created 
an 
app 
that 
would 
update 
the 
context 
(location 
using 
GPS) 
with 
a 
high 
frequency 
and 
found 
out 
that 
the 
battery 
can 
drain 
out 
as 
fast 
as 
ve 
hours, 
given 
certain 
conditions 
are 
true. 
Energy 
ecient 
privacy 
management 
therefore 
becomes, 
an 
important 
goal. 
In 
our 
ongoing 
work 
we 
have 
presented 
a 
three-fold 
solution 
towards 
achieving 
this 
ultimate 
goal 
[3]. 


In 
this 
paper 
we 
focus 
on 
the 
sub-solution 
of 
sensor 
selection 
to 
achieve 
energy 
eciency. 
We 
present 
the 
design 
of 
the 
COntext 
MANager 
miDDleware 
(COMANDD) 
for 
achievin
g 
the 
sub-goal. 
We 
extend 
a 
mobile 
ontology 
i.e. 
PlatMob 
[6, 
5] 
from 
our 
previous 
work 
to 
include 
the 
concept 
of 
a 
senso
r 
on 
a 
device 
and 
represent 
a 
sensor's 
capability 
(the 
type 
of 
data 
it 
senses), 
accuracy 
level 
(precision 
of 
the 
sensor) 
and 
energy 
cost 
(the 
energy 
cost 
of 
the 
sensor).

2. 
ENERGY 
EFFICIENCY 
SOLUTION 
Our 
three-fold 
solution 
for 
energy 
ecient 
privacy 
managemen
t 
is 
based 
upon 
a 
study 
and 
creation 
of 
an 
energy 
model 
for 
an 
Android 
smartphone's 
component-wise 
battery 
consumptio
n 
pattern. 
The 
base 
assumption 
in 
the 
formation 
of 
the 
model 
is 
that 
there 
are 
more 
than 
one 
sensor 
in 
a 
smartphone 
that 
can 
provide 
the 
same 
kind 
of 
data. 
For 
example 
location 
can 
be 
obtained 
using 
a 
phone's 
GPS 
or 
Internet 
connection. 
The 
steps 
in 
our 
three-fold 
approach 
are 
as 
follows. 


First, 
we 
assume 
a 
time 
period 
in 
which 
a 
sensing 
request 
would 
be 
coming 
in. 
During 
each 
time 
period, 
we 
would 
only 
enable 
the 
sensors 
that 
are 
required 
to 
satisfy 
the 
antecedent
s 
of 
relevant 
policy 
rules. 
And, 
if 
a 
set 
of 
the 
policy 
rules 
being 
enforced 
require 
the 
same 
sensor 
data 
(e.g., 
location
) 
then 
we 
take 
one 
reading 
and 
use 
it 
for 
all 
of 
the 
rules. 


Second, 
if 
certain 
information 
can 
be 
gathered 
from 
multiple 
sensors, 
we 
use 
the 
sensor 
with 
the 
lowest 
energy 
footprint 
or 
one 
that 
is 
already 
being 
used 
unless 
the 
requester 
asks 
for 
a 
higher 
precision 
on 
the 
data 
provided. 
We 
trade-off 
accuracy 
for 
energy 
eciency 
depending 
on 
the 
granularity 
requested 
by 
the 
policy. 
That 
means, 
if 
we 
have 
implemented 
a 
policy 
at 
the 
current 
time 
which 
states 
that 
provide 
only 
country 
level 
location 
data 
then 
we 
ignore 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
app 
is 
requesting 
a 
ne 
location 
as 
provided 
by 
the 
GPS. 
If 
the 
GPS 
is 
currently 
not 
switched 
on, 
we 
do 
not 
consider 
switching 
it 
on 
even 
though 
the 
app 
requested 
GPS 
location 
since 
the 
policy 
clearly 
stated 
that 
the 
data 
to 
ow 
has 
to 
be 
at 
country 
level. 


Third, 
if 
there 
are 
multiple 
conditions 
in 
the 
rule's 
antecedents 
and 
the 
rule 
is 
a 
conjunction 
of 
the 
conditions 
then 
negating 
a 
low 
cost 
condition 
will 
negate 
the 
whole 
rule. 
We 
therefore 
try 
to 
reorder 
the 
rule 
in 
order 
of 
the 
cost 
of 
the 
conditions 
in 
the 
rule's 
antecedents. 


In 
this 
paper 
we 
have 
focused 
on 
the 
second 
part 
of 
this 
three-fold 
solution. 
The 
time 
period 
based 
context 
sensing 
step 
and 
the 
reordering 
of 
the 
conditions 
in 
the 
rule's 
antecedent
s 
are 
beyond 
the 
scope 
of 
this 
paper. 


3. 
ENERGY 
AWARE 
SENSOR 
SELECTION 
In 
an 
Android 
phone, 
apps 
make 
can 
make 
requests 
for 
variou
s 
sensor 
data 
access. 
Our 
\Privacy 
Management 
Module” 
developed 
in 
previous 
work 
[5, 
6] 
requires 
context 
informatio
n 
to 
be 
updated 
frequently, 
creating 
energy 
cost 
issues. 
In 
our 
current 
work, 
we 
present 
a 
design 
of 
the 
COntext 
MANager 
miDDleware 
(COMANDD) 
that 
consists 
of 
four 
parts, 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
1: 
a 
context 
provider 
service, 
query 
engine, 
knowledge 
base 
with 
inference 
engine 
and 
context 
provisioning 
modules. 


In 
this 
solution 
we 
gather 
and 
store 
the 
latest 
context 
data 
sensed 
from 
various 
sensors 
on 
the 
phone, 
in 
a 
knowledge-base 
using 
the 
Context 
Provisioning 
Modules. 
This 
rich 
contex
t 
data 
is 
classied 
into 
four 
sensing 
groups 
at 
present. 
Current 
Android 
documentation 
broadly 
denes 
three 
categorie
s 
of 
sensors 
i.e. 
Motion, 
Environmental 
and 
Position. 
We 
have 
included 
a 
fourth 
category 
of 
sensed 
context 
data 
named 
location 
provided 
by 
the 
location 
sensors 
i.e. 
GPS, 
Wi-Fi 
and 
Cellular 
Network. 


A 
sensor 
can 
be 
characterized 
by 
properties 
like 
what 
is 
the 
sensing 
capability 
of 
the 
sensor 
or 
how 
accurate 
a 
sensor 
is 
or 
how 
much 
power 
or 
energy 
does 
the 
sensor 
consume 
for 
sensing 
purposes. 
Such 
characteristics 
may 
be 
represented 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
ontology. 
We 
extend 
the 
ontology 
names 
PlatMob 
dened 
in 
our 
previous 
work 
[5, 
6] 
to 
represent 
the 
sensor 
characteristics. 
Our 
ontology 
includes 
classes 
for 
Senso
r 
and 
SensorGroup. 
A 
sensor 
always 
belongs 
to 
a 
single 
specic 
sensor 
group. 
A 
sensor 
has 
a 
predened 
accuracy 
level. 
A 
sensor 
has 
an 
energy 
cost. 
The 
previous 
ontology 
had 
dened 
classes 
for 
Device 
with 
a 
sub 
class 
Mobile. 
We 
dene 
the 
Mobile 
class 
as 
having 
a 
listOfSensors 
property 
that 
enlists 
all 
the 
sensors 
that 
are 
available 
on 
it. 


The 
Context 
Provider 
Service 
runs 
in 
the 
background 
and 
it 
receives 
the 
requests 
as 
provided 
by 
the 
Privacy 
Managemen
t 
Module. 
The 
requests 
are 
for 
context 
data. 
The 
input 
species 
the 
category 
of 
context 
data 
required 
and 
the 
accurac
y 
level 
requested. 
The 
Query 
Engine 
then 
makes 
a 
query 
to 
the 
knowledge-base 
for 
a 
matching 
context 
data 
with 
the 
accuracy 
level 
required. 


At 
this 
point 
the 
inference 
engine 
can 
take 
two 
separate 
solution 
paths. 
First, 
if 
the 
required 
accuracy 
for 
the 
context 
requires 
the 
highest 
possible 
level, 
it 
has 
to 
search 
for 
the 
most 
accurate 
context 
data 
in 
the 
knowledge-base 
or 
access 
the 
framework 
and 
provide 
the 
required 
data. 
Second, 
if 
the 
accuracy 
is 
lower 
than 
the 
accuracy 
level 
of 
multiple 
sensors 
from 
the 
sensor 
capability 
group 
then 
it 
again 
searches 
for 
the 
context 
data 
in 
the 
knowledge-base 
and 
if 
not 
found, 
queries 
the 
low 
cost 
sensor 
to 
provide 
the 
requested 
context

Manager 
Middleware 
for 
maintaining 
and 
providing 
context 
data 
at 
a 
low 
energy 
cost 


data. 


Two 
examples: 
Let's 
consider 
that 
the 
user's 
calendar 
states 
that 
user 
is 
in 
meetings 
from 
9:00am 
to 
5:00pm 
on 
a 
weekday 
at 
a 
corporate 
location. 
We 
also 
have 
the 
GPS 
co-ordinate 
of 
the 
user 
at 
the 
corporate 
location 
at 
9:00am 
in 
the 
morning. 
We 
may 
now 
switch 
off 
the 
GPS 
and 
not 
update 
the 
location 
information 
till 
5:00pm 
in 
the 
evening. 


In 
another 
example, 
we 
have 
the 
user 
at 
his 
home 
at 
6:00am 
in 
the 
morning 
on 
a 
weekend. 
The 
user 
is 
naturally 
connecte
d 
to 
her 
home 
Wi-Fi. 
The 
user 
activity 
gathered 
from 
a 
learning 
system 
we 
developed 
in 
earlier 
work 
[18] 
we 
know 
that 
the 
user 
is 
Watching 
TV. 
In 
this 
case 
we 
do 
not 
know 
when 
the 
user 
would 
stop 
the 
current 
activity 
and 
may 
be 
go 
out. 
Therefore 
the 
context 
would 
need 
to 
be 
updated 
at 
an 
unknown 
time. 
However, 
using 
the 
accelerometer 
availabl
e 
on 
the 
phone 
we 
detect 
that 
user 
is 
in 
motion 
now 
[18]. 
Since 
the 
accelerometer 
is 
a 
low 
cost 
sensor 
we 
use 
it 
to 
determin
e 
that 
the 
user 
is 
driving 
or 
is 
stationary. 
At 
which 
point 
we 
update 
the 
context 
data 
using 
the 
costlier 
sensors 
and 
store 
it 
back 
in 
our 
knowledge-base. 


As 
seen 
from 
the 
two 
examples 
above, 
we 
can 
ascertain 
that 
context 
information 
can 
be 
associated 
with 
activities. 
Therefore, 
we 
dene 
a 
context 
change 
detection 
function. 
The 
inputs 
to 
this 
function 
are 
an 
activity 
end 
time, 
a 
low 
cost 
sensor's 
input 
denoting 
change 
in 
user 
activity 
state. 
The 
function 
determines 
if, 
the 
current 
context 
data 
is 
stale 
or 
not. 
At 
which 
point 
we 
update 
the 
context 
and 
store 
it 
back 
to 
the 
knowledge-base 
for 
future 
use. 


Thus, 
by 
modifying 
the 
process 
of 
continuous 
context 
update 
to 
a 
low 
frequency 
context 
update 
system 
we 
achieve 
energy 
ecient 
sensing.

ENERGY 
MODELING 
In 
order 
to 
make 
a 
system 
on 
a 
mobile, 
energy 
ecient 
and 
making 
selections 
of 
sensors 
to 
be 
based 
upon 
energy 
cost 
of 
individual 
sensors, 
it 
is 
rst 
and 
foremost 
necessary 
to 
explor
e 
the 
energy 
consumption 
of 
individual 
components 
on 
a 
smartphone. 
Towards 
that 
goal 
we 
created 
an 
Android 
app 
capable 
of 
collecting 
data 
of 
current 
battery 
levels. 
The 
app 
records 
any 
change 
in 
battery 
levels 
along 
with 
the 
timestamp
s 
and 
stores 
the 
information 
on 
an 
external 
storage 
on 
the 
phone. 
We 
created 
a 
baseline 
for 
the 
bare 
bone 
Androi
d 
system 
in 
airplane 
mode. 
This 
ensured 
that 
there 
was 
no 
network 
communication. 
We 
also 
ensured 
that 
no 
other 
apps 
were 
running 
on 
the 
system. 
Using 
Android 
programmin
g 
constructs 
we 
ensured 
that 
the 
system 
was 
running 
only 
the 
operating 
system 
on 
its 
own 
and 
nothing 
else. 
We 
drained 
the 
battery 
out 
in 
this 
condition. 
Our 
technique 
thus 
provided 
us 
with 
battery 
consumption 
pattern 
which 
formed 
the 
baseline 
for 
our 
energy 
model. 


Creation 
of 
the 
energy 
model 
that 
was 
carried 
out 
included 
the 
task 
of 
selecting 
a 
component 
that 
we 
wanted 
to 
model. 
Selection 
was 
done 
for 
all 
possible 
sensors 
in 
each 
individua
l 
sensor 
group 
(mentioned 
in 
previous 
section). 
Once 
a 
component 
was 
selected 
we 
yet 
again 
used 
an 
Android 
app 
to 
run 
that 
component, 
refreshing 
the 
data 
obtained 
over 
small 
time 
intervals 
and 
storing 
the 
battery 
level 
changes, 
timestamps 
and 
the 
sensor 
data 
obtained. 
At 
present 
we 
have 
created 
models 
for 
location 
detection 
sensors. 
Figure 
2 
shows 
the 
comparative 
battery 
drainage 
time 
for 
Wi-Fi, 
Network, 
GPS 
and 
the 
baseline 
system. 


From 
the 
model 
we 
were 
able 
to 
calculate 
the 
average 
values 
of 
energy 
consumption 
of 
the 
sensors 
under 
test 
as 
follows:


The 
energy 
model 
data 
was 
incorporated 
into 
our 
extension 
of 
the 
place 
ontology 
explained 
in 
the 
previous 
section. 


The 
other 
aspect 
of 
location 
sensors 
that 
we 
studied 
in 
our 
work 
was 
of 
location 
accuracy 
with 
respect 
to 
a 
baseline.

We 
observed 
that 
although 
Wi-Fi 
consumed 
relatively 
low 
energy. 
It 
showed 
fairly 
accurate 
location 
results, 
given 
the 
assumption 
that 
we 
were 
able 
to 
connect 
to 
a 
Wi-Fi 
locatio
n 
and 
even 
if 
we 
are 
connected 
the 
Wi-Fi 
access 
point 
has 
been 
updated 
to 
the 
Wi-Fi 
hotspot 
databases. 
Network 
localization 
on 
other 
hand 
were 
highly 
inaccurate 
and 
unstable
. 
The 
high 
energy 
cost 
associated 
with 
the 
network 
can 
be 
attributed 
to 
3G 
data 
transmission 
energy 
cost.

shows 
the

predicted, 
from 
the 
absolute

GPS,

RELATED 
WORK 
Privacy 
management: 
Our 
approach 
for 
privacy 
managemen
t 
diers 
from 
those 
in 
the 
literature 
[2, 
17, 
4] 
on 
context 
based 
privacy 
and 
security. 
Using 
semantically 
rich 
policies 
and 
the 
user 
and 
user 
application 
context 
we 
undertake 
a 
reasoning 
method 
to 
decide 
the 
choice 
of 
either 
releasing 
or 
obfuscating 
the 
sensor/context 
data 
being 
shared 
with 
the 
application 
[5, 
6, 
14]. 
We 
obtain 
rich 
context 
mapping 
between 
a 
location 
and 
its 
surroundings, 
the 
presence 
of 
people 
and 
devices, 
inferred 
activities 
and 
the 
roles 
people 
ll 
in 
them. 
All 
the 
facts 
are 
inferred 
by 
a 
model 
created 
by 
using 
a 
machine 
learning 
system 
trained 
on 
user 
data 
[19]. 
The 
context 
realized 
as 
a 
dynamic 
knowledge-base 
of 
RDF 
triples 
is 
grounded 
in 
an 
ontology 
expressed 
in 
the 
semantic 
web 
language 
OWL. 
All 
policies 
are 
encoded 
in 
form 
of 
SWRL 
[13] 
rules 
and 
use 
conjunctions 
of 
facts 
in 
the 
context 
knowledge-base 
in 
their 
conditions. 
The 
rules 


control 
the 
sensor 
data 
ow 
from 
the 
Android 
framework 
to 
the 
requesting 
app. 
When 
policies 
necessitate 
protectio
n 
of 
certain 
data 
ow 
form 
sensors 
to 
an 
app 
the 
data 
is 
obfuscated. 
Our 
ontology 
represents 
the 
concept 
of 
applicatio
n 
provenance 
that 
is 
used 
in 
policies. 
The 
resulting 
system 
provides 
ne-grained, 
context-dependent 
control 
to 
sensitive 
user 
data 
[5]. 


Energy 
eciency: 
Current 
work 
in 
the 
literature 
on 
the 
energ
y 
consumption 
study 
focuses 
on 
exact 
battery 
utilization 
of 
specic 
applications 
and 
also 
refers 
to 
tail 
energy 
issues 
[16], 
but 
has 
not 
dealt 
with 
creating 
an 
energy 
ecient 
contex
t 
inference 
system 
that 
can 
be 
used 
for 
security. 
In 
ongoin
g 
work 
we 
have 
carried 
out 
studies 
on 
Android 
smart-phones 
to 
nd 
out 
energy 
consumption 
pattern 
of 
individual 
sensors 
and 
their 
accuracy 
values. 
[3]. 
We 
group 
sensors 
according 
to 
the 
type 
of 
data 
they 
sense. 
Android's 
develope
r 
documentation 
has 
a 
basic 
classication 
of 
the 
sensor 
categories 
[8], 
i.e. 
Motion, 
Position 
and 
Environment. 
The 
context 
data 
we 
are 
trying 
to 
infer 
or 
gather 
or 
pass 
includes 
a 
fourth 
category 
of 
sensors 
called 
Location. 
We 
utilize 
the 
localization 
capable 
components 
as 
sensors 
in 
this 
case. 


Acquisitional 
Context 
Engine 
(ACE) 
is 
a 
work 
done 
in 
energ
y 
ecient 
context 
inference. 
This 
work 
includes 
the 
notio
n 
of 
Inference 
Caching 
and 
Context 
Correlation 
Mining. 
In 
our 
current 
work 
we 
have 
adopted 
a 
unique 
approach 
of 
dening 
a 
function 
that 
would 
specify 
that 
the 
context 
is 
outdated 
and 
needs 
to 
be 
updated. 
Given 
an 
initial 
location 
and 
activity 
context, 
we 
use 
a 
function 
with 
inputs 
of 
activit
y 
length, 
current 
time 
and 
a 
low 
cost 
motion 
sensor 
like 
accelerometer 
to 
determine 
whether 
there 
was 
any 
change 
in 
context 
or 
not. 
Thus 
we 
avoid 
updating 
context 
altogether 
by 
using 
a 
low 
energy 
costing 
sensor 
and 
avoid 
the 
need 
to 
maintain 
a 
caching 
mechanism.

ONGOING 
WORK 
In 
this 
paper 
we 
have 
provided 
a 
design 
of 
an 
energy 
ecien
t 
privacy 
management 
solution. 
We 
are 
in 
process 
of 



implementing 
the 
middleware 
for 
which 
we 
have 
provided 
the 
design 
here. 
Evaluation 
of 
the 
system 
poses 
to 
be 
a 
challenge. 
We 
plan 
to 
implement 
two 
separate 
systems 
with 
and 
without 
the 
context 
manager 
middleware 
and 
compare 
and 
contrast 
the 
results 
to 
evaluate 
our 
system 
for 
various 
privacy 
manager 
use 
cases. 


The 
research 
work 
done 
here 
is 
based 
on 
the 
data 
that 
can 
be 
successfully 
obtained 
using 
Android 
framework 
provided 
data. 
The 
best 
precision 
of 
data 
available 
through 
the 
framewor
k 
is 
a 
one 
percent 
change 
in 
the 
battery 
level. 
Although 
the 
expected 
battery 
drain 
is 
linear. 
It 
may 
not 
be 
exactly 
linear. 
We 
are 
working 
on 
other 
phones 
and 
carrying 
out 
research 
by 
varying 
the 
parameters 
that 
aect 
accuracy 
and 
eciency. 
We 
eventually 
intend 
to 
collect 
enough 
data 
to 
run 
a 
learning 
algorithm 
and 
generate 
a 
model 
le. 
When 
this 
model 
would 
be 
put 
on 
a 
phone 
it 
will 
be 
able 
to 
predict 
the 
energy 
consumption 
patterns 
of 
the 
phones 
components 
and 
adjust 
the 
model 
if 
necessary. 


In 
course 
of 
our 
research, 
we 
observed 
that 
frequent 
update 
to 
location 
context 
had 
a 
signicant 
impact 
on 
the 
battery. 
GPS 
position 
x 
although 
takes 
substantial 
time 
initially 


[15] 
but 
once 
obtained, 
provides 
high 
accuracy 
in 
location 
information. 
Wi-Fi, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
had 
relatively 
lower 
precision 
but 
got 
initial 
position 
x 
faster 
at 
known 
Wi-Fi 
access 
point 
locations. 
We 
do 
take 
advantage 
of 
this 
trade-off 
of 
location 
precision 
versus 
energy 
measurements 
to 
optimiz
e 
our 
energy 
eciency 
algorithm. 
But 
we 
have 
not 
considered 
the 
time 
to 
obtain 
this 
x 
with 
respect 
to 
energy 
consumption. 
We 
would 
like 
to 
study 
this 
aspect 
in 
the 
future
. 
We 
have 
created 
the 
policy-based 
security 
mechanism 
in 
the 
Android 
framework 
[5, 
6] 
and 
have 
designed 
and 
partiall
y 
implemented 
the 
energy 
ecient 
privacy 
framework. 
Evaluating 
this 
system, 
however 
remains 
to 
be 
done.
